# Machine_Learning_Model_On_HR_Dataset
1.	Understanding the Dataset (STA set):
•	I went through the dataset to understand its nature and requirements. This typically involves understanding the features, their types, and the target variable.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, which involves examining the data's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables. This step helps in gaining insights into the dataset.
3.	Data Set Characteristics:
•	Checked the size of the dataset: This involves understanding how many rows and columns are present in the dataset.
•	Checked for missing values: Analyzing if there are any missing values in the dataset and deciding how to handle them.
4.	Statistical EDA:
•	Performed statistical exploratory data analysis, which could include summary statistics, distributions, and other statistical measures to understand the dataset better.
5.	Feature Selection:
•	Used cross-tab validations for feature selection: Cross-tabulation (cross-tab) is a technique that can be used for analyzing the relationship between two categorical variables I used this technique to help in feature selection.
6.	Model Building:
•	Built models using four algorithms: I applied machine learning algorithms to the dataset. The choice of algorithms would depend on the nature of the problem (regression, classification, etc.) and the characteristics of the data.
•	Compared R2 score and mean values: I evaluated the models based on R2 score and mean values, which are common metrics for regression tasks.
7.	Choosing the Best Model:
•	Identified a better model for the dataset: Based on the comparison of R2 scores and mean values, I selected the model that performed better for the specific dataset.
